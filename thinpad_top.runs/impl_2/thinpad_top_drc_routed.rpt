LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
11 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is openmips0/ex_mem0/bitEnable_o_reg[3]_0. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: openmips0/ex_mem0/i__i_1, openmips0/ex_mem0/i__i_2, openmips0/ex_mem0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_9, openmips0/ex_mem0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_12, openmips0/ex_mem0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_18, openmips0/ex_mem0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_24, openmips0/ex_mem0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_27, openmips0/tlb0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_31, openmips0/ex_mem0/new_pc_reg[31]_i_36, openmips0/tlb0/ramAddr_o[9]_i_2, openmips0/tlb0/ramAddr_o[19]_i_5.

DSP openmips0/ex0/hilo_temp output openmips0/ex0/hilo_temp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	clock_btn_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to H19
	clock_btn_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y11
